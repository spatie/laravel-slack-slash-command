This package makes it easy to make your Laravel app respond to [Slack's Slash commands](https://api.slack.com/slash-commands). 

Once you've setup your Slash command over at Slack and installed this package into a Laravel app you can create handlers that can handle a slash command. Here's an example of such a handler that will send a response back to slack.

```php
namespace App\SlashCommandHandlers;

use App\SlashCommand\BaseHandler;
use Spatie\SlashCommand\Request;
use Spatie\SlashCommand\Response;

class CatchAll extends BaseHandler
{
    /**
     * If this function returns true, the handle method will get called.
     *
     * @param \Spatie\SlashCommand\Request $request
     *
     * @return bool
     */
    public function canHandle(Request $request): bool
    {
        return true;
    }

    /**
     * Handle the given request. Remember that Slack expects a response
     * within three seconds after the slash command was issued. If
     * there is more time needed, dispatch a job.
     * 
     * @param \Spatie\SlashCommand\Request $request
     * 
     * @return \Spatie\SlashCommand\Response
     */
    public function handle(Request $request): Response
    {
        return $this->respondToSlack("You have typed this text: `{$request->text}`");
    }
}
```

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

``` bash
composer require spatie/laravel-slack-slash-command
```

This service provider must be installed.

```php
// config/app.php
'providers' => [
    ...
    Spatie\SlashCommand\SlashCommandServiceProvider::class,
];
```

You can publish the config-file with:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Spatie\SlashCommand\SlashCommandServiceProvider"
```

This is the contents of the published file:

```php
return [

    /*
     * At the integration settings over at Slack you can configure the url to which the 
     * slack commands are posted. Specify the path component of that url here. 
     * 
     * For `http://example.com/slack` you would put `slack` here.
     */
    'url' => 'slack',

    /*
     * The token generated by Slack with which to verify if a incoming slash command request is valid.
     */
    'token' => env('SLACK_SLASH_COMMAND_VERIFICATION_TOKEN'),
    
    /*
     * The signing_secret generated by Slack with which to verify if a incoming slash command request is valid.
     */
    'signing_secret' => env('SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET'),

    /*
     * Verify requests from slack with signing_secret signature
     */
    'verify_with_signing' => false,

    /*
     * The handlers that will process the slash command. We'll call handlers from top to bottom
     * until the first one whose `canHandle` method returns true.
     */
    'handlers' => [
        //add your own handlers here


        //this handler will display instructions on how to use the various commands.
        Spatie\SlashCommand\Handlers\Help::class,

        //this handler will respond with a `Could not handle command` message.
        Spatie\SlashCommand\Handlers\CatchAll::class,
    ],
];

```
Change `verify_with_signing` parameter to verify requests from slack by `signing_secret`:
```php
// config/laravel-slack-slash-command.php
'verify_with_signing' => true
```
